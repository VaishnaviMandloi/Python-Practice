#### List
- List are mutable
- they are container to store different types of objects . They are used to iterate objects.
- Syntax of List :  
   list = ['a', 'b', 1, 3, 4]
- The iterartion performed in list is comparetively slower than tuple.
- Insertion , deletion operation can be performed better.
- It consume more memory.
  
#### Tuple
- tuple are immutable.
- tuple are container that store different type of immutable objects.
- Syntax of tuple :
  tuple = ( 'a', 'b', 1, 2, 3)
- it consume less memory
- iteration is processed faster.
- element can be accessed faster.
